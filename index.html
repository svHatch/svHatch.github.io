<h1 id="personal-statement">Personal Statement</h1>
<p>I am a pragmatic and personable coastal geographer. I strive to complement my technical skills with an excellence in communicative and collaborative qualities. My training has provided me with a grounding in modern GIS and remote sensing technologies, and my experience in research has given me the analytical abilities inherent in applied geomorphological study. I am now fully committed to the research of geospatial applications to regional climate change adaptation.</p>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<p><strong>Short</strong> - Provide geospatial services in areas of coastal hazards and adaptation planning.</p>
<p><strong>Long</strong> - Work to assist the adaptation of coastal populations to projected climatic change using the powerful decision support provided by geospatial technology.</p>

<p>For the purpose of preservation, as well as to facilitate analysis, some rock carvings made on the face of a cave were scanned at very high resolution using a white-light scanner. The carvings are located on the Chatham Islands, which are a group of islands east of New Zealand. This was done by the Archaeology and Surveying departments of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. My job was to attempt to automate the process of detecting the carvings from the surveying data in order to quickly map their layout on the carving face.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age of the rock face carvings: ~300 years</li>
<li>Total number of individual survey points taken by the scanner: &gt; 100 million</li>

<p>I was involved in a project that aimed to quantify the effect of highly oblique winds in transporting sand over a coastal dune. This coastal dune, located on the southern coast of Dunedin, New Zealand, is adjacent to municipal lands, and is bordered by a large road made of backfill. The project used in situ measurement techniques to quantify the effects of steering and acceleration of the regional winds due to the local topography of the dune.</p>

<p>The goal of the CanCoast project is to improve upon the existing Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) from Shaw et.al. (1998) using updated information on Geology, Coastline shape, permafrost, and socioeconomic variables. To do this, a GIS with all relevant layers was created, and then a new formula for calculating a vulnerability index was developed.</p>

<p>The community plans for the Inuit towns within Nunatsiavut, in northern Labrador, rely on planners from Ottawa. This presents challenges when it comes to community assets that are cultural and unmapped. The planners wanted to incorporate this information into community plans, as well as fill in data gaps to do with projected climatic change. A partnership with Memorial University allowed this problem to be tackled.</p>

<p>As part of my final project I attempted a 3D model of a scuba tank underwater using oblqiue photogrammetry. This is very common place now (structure from motion has advanced rapidly since then), but at the time I had a lot of fun diving into new avenues of photogrammetry.</p>

<p>Hippalus has retained a seat in those remembered from ancient history as a great navigator. It was he who cleverly began sailing due East once leaving the Gulf of Aden and arriving on the Western coast of India, when all others assumed this would be a suicide mission. His fame even gave his name to monsoon winds that made his feat possible. The evidence we have, however, for his existence is faint, but his story could help elucidate the way mythology shaped the ancient Graeco-Roman world.</p>

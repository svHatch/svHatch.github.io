<h1 id="personal-statement">Personal Statement</h1>
<p>My career must be of service. My life, through my work, reflects an urge to do good. To do this I am furthering my understanding of three questions: (1) how can humans best adapt their coastal communities to the projected challenges of climate change? (2) what tools provide the most efficient means of applying the answer to question number 1? Finally, (3) How can we improve these tools? In answer to these three questions I am building a career as a coastal geographer with skills in physical geography, spatial information science, and geospatial technologies.</p>

<h2 id="automating-the-mapping-of-archaeological-rock-carvings-on-the-chatham-islands-new-zealand">Automating the mapping of archaeological rock carvings on the Chatham Islands, New Zealand</h2>
<p>For the purpose of preservation, as well as to facilitate analysis, some rock carvings made on the face of a cave were scanned at very high resolution using a white-light scanner. This was done by the Archaeology and Surveying departments of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. My job was to attempt to automate the process of detecting the carvings from the surveying data in order to quickly map their layout on the carving face.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age of the rock face carvings:</li>
<li>Total number of individual survey points taken by the scanner:</li>

<h2 id="storm-effects-on-an-urban-coastal-dune">Storm effects on an urban coastal dune</h2>
<p>I was involved in a project that aimed to quantify the effect of highly oblique winds in transporting sand over a coastal dune. This coastal dune, located on the southern coast of Dunedin, New Zealand, is adjacent to municipal lands, and is bordered by a large road made of backfill. The project used in situ measurement techniques to quantify the effects of steering and acceleration of the regional winds due to the local topography of the dune.</p>

<h2 id="marine-geodatabase-decision-support-system-for-hawkes-bay-regional-council">Marine geodatabase decision support system for Hawkes Bay Regional Council</h2>
<p>The Hawkes Bay Regional Council needed an integrated system to store and organize their multi-sourced data relevant to fisheries management decisions. I assisted eCoast Ltd. in providing them with a solution.</p>

<h2 id="cancoast---providing-a-national-estimate-of-coastal-vulnerability">CanCoast - providing a national estimate of coastal vulnerability</h2>
<p>The goal of the CanCoast project is to improve upon the existing Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) from Shaw et.al. (1998) using updated information on Geology, Coastline shape, permafrost, and socioeconomic variables. To do this, a GIS with all relevant layers was created, and then a new formula for calculating a vulnerability index was developed.</p>

<h2 id="underwater-photogrammetry-at-the-centre-of-geographic-sciences">Underwater photogrammetry at the Centre of Geographic Sciences</h2>
<p>As part of my final project I attempted a 3D model of a scuba tank underwater using oblqiue photogrammetry. This is very common place now (structure from motion has advanced rapidly since then), but at the time I had a lot of fun diving into new avenues of photogrammetry.</p>

<p>The community plans for the Inuit towns within Nunatsiavut, in northern Labrador, rely on planners from Ottawa. This presents challenges when it comes to community assets that are cultural and unmapped. The planners wanted to incorporate this information into community plans, as well as fill in data gaps to do with projected climatic change. A partnership with Memorial University allowed this problem to be tackled.</p>

<p>The city of Iqaluit needed an assessment of coastal hazards within Koojesse Inlet, the main inlet servicing the city, in order to incorporate proper planning into its five year plan, as well as it's long-term climate change adaptation plan.</p>

<p>Hippalus has retained a seat in those remembered from ancient history as a great navigator. It was he who cleverly began sailing due East once leaving the Gulf of Aden and arriving on the Western coast of India, when all others assumed this would be a suicide mission. His fame even gave his name to monsoon winds that made his feat possible. The evidence we have, however, for his existence is faint, but his story could help elucidate the way mythology shaped the ancient Graeco-Roman world.</p>

<p>Severe algal blooms occur in lake Ainslie, located in the northern part of Cape Breton island, Nova Scotia. We can track these blooms from space, map their extent within the lake, and even compute estimates of Chl-A concentrations based on reflectance values in multi-spectral imagery.</p>
